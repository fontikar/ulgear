# Webscrap UL gear specs

This is toy project to learn how to webscrap using the R package [{rvest}](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/index.html). 

The goal is to grab the specs (weight, dimensions, price) of ultralight tents 
that are on the market and wrangle this data into a standardised format. 

The URLs of the tents I want to grab are found in this [view only Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11LaC3Eh5Y_YLsO08YJ_JTxO-b6qnbu_eZLK0NTZGS-Q/edit?usp=sharing)
